## Domain Model Requirements
I want to add tasks to my todo list.
I want to see all the tasks in my todo list.
I want to change the status of a task between incomplete and complete.
I want to be able to get only the complete tasks.
I want to be able to get only the incomplete tasks.
I want to search for a task and receive a message that says it wasn't found if it doesn't exist.
I want to remove tasks from my list.
I want to see all the tasks in my list ordered alphabetically in ascending order.
I want to see all the tasks in my list ordered alphabetically in descending order.

I want to be able to get a task by a unique ID.
I want to update the name of a task by providing its ID and a new name.
I want to be able to change the status of a task by providing its ID.
I want to be able to see the date and time that I created each task.

Ï just read all the requirements and not the whole task description, therefore i have not done the Core task first, but i have combined the Core and Extenstion requirements in my code. 
Hope that it is okay, next time i will read the assignment correctly:)!

Task == Job, because of the Task.cs already existing
